# Gemini Code Assistant Report: Hummingbot Gateway

This report provides a comprehensive overview of the Hummingbot Gateway codebase, generated by the Gemini Code Assistant. Its purpose is to offer a clear, concise, and accurate summary for developers, new contributors, and stakeholders.

## 1. Project Overview

**Hummingbot Gateway** is a versatile API and Model Context Protocol (MCP) server designed to standardize interactions with various blockchain networks and decentralized exchanges (DEXs). It acts as a middleware layer, providing a unified interface for performing actions like checking balances, executing trades, and managing wallets across different protocols.

### Key Features:

- **Standardized REST API**: Exposes consistent endpoints for interacting with blockchains (Ethereum, Solana) and DEXs (Uniswap, Jupiter, Raydium, Meteora).
- **MCP Integration**: Functions as an MCP server, allowing AI assistants like Claude to interact with the gateway using natural language. This enables complex trading operations through conversational prompts.
- **Modular Architecture**: Built with a clear separation of concerns, with distinct modules for chains, connectors, configuration, and wallet management.
- **Typescript-based**: Leverages the Typescript ecosystem and popular libraries like Fastify, Ethers.js, and Solana/web3.js.
- **Extensible**: Designed to be easily extended with new chains and connectors.

### Core Technologies:

- **Backend**: Node.js, Typescript, Fastify
- **Blockchain Interaction**: Ethers.js (Ethereum), @solana/web3.js (Solana)
- **Package Manager**: pnpm
- **Testing**: Jest
- **Linting/Formatting**: ESLint, Prettier

## 2. Codebase Structure

The project follows a well-organized, modular structure that promotes maintainability and scalability.

```

## 3. Key Components & Abstractions

### Chains

The `src/chains` directory contains the logic for interacting with specific blockchain networks. Each chain module typically includes:

- **`chain.ts`**: The core class that implements the chain's functionality (e.g., `getBalances`, `getTokens`).
- **`chain.routes.ts`**: Defines the API routes for the chain.
- **`chain.config.ts`**: Manages the chain's configuration.

### Connectors

The `src/connectors` directory houses the implementations for different DEX protocols. Each connector is tailored to a specific DEX and provides methods for:

- **Quoting**: Getting price quotes for swaps.
- **Trading**: Executing trades.
- **Liquidity Pool Info**: Fetching information about liquidity pools.

Connectors are categorized by the type of DEX model they support (e.g., AMM, CLMM).

### MCP Server

The `src/mcp` directory contains the implementation of the Model Context Protocol server. This is a key feature that allows for natural language interaction with the gateway. It exposes the gateway's functionality as a set of "tools" that can be called by an AI assistant.

### Services

The `src/services` directory provides essential services that are used throughout the application, such as:

- **`config-manager-v2.ts`**: A robust configuration manager that handles loading and validating configuration files.
- **`logger.ts`**: A flexible logging service.
- **`token-list-resolution.ts`**: Manages token lists for different chains.

## 4. Getting Started

To get started with the Hummingbot Gateway, you'll need to have Node.js and pnpm installed.

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hummingbot/gateway.git
   cd gateway
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```

4. **Run the setup script**:
   ```bash
   pnpm run setup
   ```

5. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   pnpm start --passphrase=<YOUR_PASSPHRASE>
   ```

## 5. Testing

The project has a comprehensive test suite using Jest. To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
pnpm test
```

The tests are located in the `test/` directory and mirror the structure of the `src/` directory.

## 6. Summary

The Hummingbot Gateway is a well-engineered and powerful tool for interacting with the decentralized web. Its modular architecture, standardized API, and innovative MCP integration make it a valuable asset for developers and traders alike. The codebase is clean, well-documented, and easy to navigate, making it a great project for new contributors to get involved with.
