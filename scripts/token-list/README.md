# Token List Management Scripts

This directory contains scripts for managing token lists for Ethereum and Solana networks.

## Available Scripts

### Ethereum Scripts

- `filter_ethereum_tokens.js`: Filters the Ethereum mainnet token list to only include tokens in the top 1000 by market cap on CoinGecko
- `filter_ethereum_top200.js`: Filters the Ethereum mainnet token list to only include tokens in the top 200 by market cap on CoinGecko plus HBOT
- `add_missing_ethereum_tokens.js`: Identifies and adds top 1000 tokens from CoinGecko that are missing from the Ethereum token list
- `remove_logo_uri.js`: Removes the logoURI field from all tokens in the Ethereum mainnet token list
- `filter_base_tokens.js`: Filters and adds tokens from the top 1000 by market cap on CoinGecko to the Base network token list

### Solana Scripts

- `filter_solana_tokens.js`: Filters the Solana token list to only include tokens in the top 1000 by market cap on CoinGecko
- `filter_solana_top200.js`: Filters the Solana token list to only include tokens in the top 200 by market cap on CoinGecko plus SOL
- `add_missing_solana_tokens.js`: Identifies and adds top 1000 tokens from CoinGecko that are missing from the Solana token list

### Reference Scripts

- `add_missing_tokens_original.js`: Original script for adding missing tokens (replaced by optimized versions)

## Usage

Each script can be run using Node.js from the root of the project:

```bash
# Filter Ethereum token list to top 1000
node scripts/token-list/filter_ethereum_tokens.js

# Filter Ethereum token list to top 200 plus HBOT
node scripts/token-list/filter_ethereum_top200.js

# Add missing Ethereum tokens
node scripts/token-list/add_missing_ethereum_tokens.js

# Remove logoURI fields from Ethereum tokens
node scripts/token-list/remove_logo_uri.js

# Filter and add top tokens to Base network list
node scripts/token-list/filter_base_tokens.js

# Filter Solana token list to top 1000
node scripts/token-list/filter_solana_tokens.js

# Filter Solana token list to top 200 plus SOL
node scripts/token-list/filter_solana_top200.js

# Add missing Solana tokens
node scripts/token-list/add_missing_solana_tokens.js
```

## Data Directory

The `data` directory contains output files generated by these scripts, such as:

- Lists of tokens from CoinGecko API
- Filtered token lists
- Updated token lists with added tokens

## Rate Limiting

Note that these scripts implement rate limiting when calling the CoinGecko API to prevent being blocked. If you encounter rate limit errors, the scripts will automatically wait and retry.

## Token List Locations

The token lists are located at:

- Ethereum: `src/templates/lists/mainnet.json`
- Solana: `src/templates/lists/solana.json`

After running any of these scripts, be sure to test the changes by building the project:

```bash
pnpm build
```
